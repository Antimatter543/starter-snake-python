1. GetSafeMoves function -> This is good not only for checking wall collisions, etc. but also enemy body collisions (and your own).

For efficiency of code, we can code the collisions to work like this:
Function: 2. Get_adjacent_tiles(position): (4 adjacent tiles of a position). (+ the direction you'd have to go to get there?)
Then, in getsafe: Get adjacent tiles, then check if there's any body type entities in there (based on what move you'd make). If there is an entity, remove it from safemoves. 
Also remove anything over the world border limit from safemoves.

Then return the safemoves (i.e the directions).
3. GetNextMove function (it's like a better)
